# HD98800-orbit

This repository is part of the work developed for the publication [The HD 98800 quadruple pre-main sequence system. Towards full orbital characterisation using long-baseline infrared interferometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02841). 


We modelled our dataset with the [exoplanet](https://github.com/exoplanet-dev/exoplanet) software package, which extends the PyMC3 framework to support many of the custom functions and distributions required when fitting orbital parameters. Each folder contains the datasets, PyMC3 models and the MCMC samples  corresponding to the outer orbit (AB) and both subsystem (BbBb and AaAb) orbital fitting.
